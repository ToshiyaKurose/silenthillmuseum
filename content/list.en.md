Have you read the article "The Ghostly Case of Walter Sullivan" yet? If you haven't read it yet, please continue the conversation via D4-mail.

The article claims "walter is he" is the murderer's message, but doesn't seem this unnatural? Now, take a good look at the first tourist brochure you picked up. Yes, it's a keepsake of a still unknown victim of this serial killer case.  
Here, the URL of the article is "https\://www.silenthill-historicalsociety.com/[cryptic message through the murders]/", right? Then, try changing this message to the correct one.
