By the way, according to the director's staff blog (posted on November 23, 2021), there is a super hard version that you can try when you visit the museum...

## D4-mail

Soon after you see the message from RAY, you receive an email from Ruby. Let's follow her instructions. Don't have the code on the tourist guide? Try searching for X, reddit, etc.  
But be careful, this could lead to you getting involved in an incident.

{{< accordion title="Threatening incident" >}}

Approximately one day after the initial interaction, you receive a threatening email from someone calling themself unknown, followed by several related emails.  
It's up to you what you do after reading those emails.

{{< accordion title="Message from Ruby" >}}

About a day later, you receive an email from Ruby.  
I guess it's okay to trust her, right?

{{< accordion title="Get involved in an incident" >}}

One day later, the incident is discovered and your and Ruby's lives are threatened. To protect yourself, you must find Felix's login information and delete your data as soon as possible.

{{< accordion title="Login information" >}}

You can find out the ID/password rules from the login information provided by Ruby and Ruby's profile.  
ID is "First name + Last Initial + Year the person joined the museum", and password is what the person likes. Therefore, Felix's login information is as follows:

|ID|Password|

## Accusations of a man who risked his life

When you piece together the seven hidden messages (24~30/36), you get the following:

{{< accordion title="Accusation" >}}

> If something goes down, I stashed the message on this site.  
> I'm the only one who could pull that off.  
> Isabel Smith's my aunt.  
> She was always all smiles.  
> She got caught up in that unsolved serial murder in this town and passed away when I was 12.  
> I'm so sorry she left her little daughter behind.  
> That's why I thought I should try to solve this case myself.  
> One day, completely by chance, I stumbled upon something unexpected. I found a person using an alias.  
> He's the one who saved my life.  
> I started searching for the reason he was using an alias.  
> Then some facts started to come together.  
> All I had was a bad feeling.  
> I was speechless by the hypothesis I came up with.  
> This person must be the true culprit in the case.  
> I'm trying to solve.  
> In the near future, I gotta hit him with my conclusion.  
> I can't even imagine what I'll find out.

Given his age, it is believed that Felix Crain wrote the accusation. (If you don't know who he is, continue exploring the website.)  
Who is the person in question?
